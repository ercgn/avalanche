Note: This is the AUDIO version of Avalanche!

Welcome to Avalanche!
Created by Eric Gan
Term Project for 15-112 taught under Professor David Kosbie.

If you are using the NON-AUDIO version of this game, you only need Python 2.6.2 to run it! Just make sure you also have the Tkinter module installed too. 

If you are using the AUDIO version of this game, you will need to install the module pygame. The module can be downloaded from www.pygame.org/download.shtml and download the appropriate file based on your operating system. Just follow the instructions given on the site!

This game was programmed on Mac OS X version 10.8.2 using the built-in python 2.6.2, so the pygame module I downloaded was the one labeled "Lion apple supplied python:". 

To run this game, run Terminal (or the Windows equivalent) and redirect to this directory. Then run "main.py" to launch the game! 

Hope you enjoy the game!
