Tried to figure out how to implement jumping by looing at physics equations.11/28/12	5:00	6:02	1	Met with Asa. Added some variables11/28/12	8:02	8:55	1	Implemented more variables.11/29/12	11:25	12:17	1	Started to draw the main interface. Looked into KeyPressed events on 15-112 website for smooth navigating11/29/12	11:02	0:44	1.75	"Got my rectangle moving left and right, and got portal to work. Next step, getting my thing to jump."11/30/12	1:13	1:48	0.5	"Tried to figure out how to get the canvas to ""jump"" by shifting the whole canvas/scroll view."11/30/12	2:00	2:30	0.5	"Got jump to ""work"" but not display correctly."11/30/12	9:30	11:18	2	Got jump to work correctly.. Almost! Added falling blocks that disappear when they hit the ground. Tried to make moving smoother.11/30/12	1:33	2:18	0.75	Got player to jump correctly after debugging! Now trying to figure out how to place blocks onto the floor (and collision detection)11/30/12	3:30	4:02	0.5	Played some avalanche. Tried to get collision to work.12/1/12		3:00	3:30	0.5	"Attempted to program jumping and collision detection on things other than the floor, but did not work."12/1/12		1:03	1:24	0.5	Tried to get jump to work on top of blocks. 12/1/12		4:00	6:50	3	Got my blocks to stack! Now working on jumping.12/1/12		7:56	9:30	1.5	Got player to jump on blocks correctly! Still working on a bug where player falls through a block in mid-air after about 2 seconds…12/1/12		9:45	1:27	3.75	"Player now jumps on blocks correctly. Falls down correctly. Fixed annoying bug where player goes ""inside"" a block when L/R move is illegal."12/2/12		12:05	3:10	3	Fixed top/town collision. Need to rewrite L/R collision. Still small bug for T/D collision that needs to be fixed. Banged head from time to time.12/2/12		3:30	5:06	1.5	Realized a small bug with block stacking…and fixed it! Got top/bottom collision to work for the most part. L/R still problematic.12/2/12		11:30	12:25	0.75	"For the most part, fixed L/R movement. Still buggy though."12/3/12		2:00	2:56	1	Lots of debugging… not much improvement.12/3/12		3:30	4:00	0.5	Fixed L/R movement bug with a hack (unfortunately). 12/4/12		2:15	2:45	0.5	Added wall jumping. Noticed a new interesting (rare) bug….12/4/12		1:20	2:54	1.5	Added general GUI stuff. Tried to fix wrap-around bug12/4/12		4:15	6:37	2.25	Added Smash. Fixed (somewhat) wrap-around bug. Added a way to actually lose the game. Added water. Made a lose-game indicator. Also made instructions page.12/4/12		10:00	11:55	2	"Fixed some bugs. Generally still buggy, but playable now! Added Credits Page. Finishing Touches!"12/5/12		4:32	6:34	2	Added music using pygame; added death effect. Recorded video. Finishing touches.							Total	36.75
